How to Mental Anguish Quiz Management System

Overview:
The external data file 'questions.csv' maintains a list of quiz questions. Each
question has the question text, four answer choices, positive and negative feedback
(depending on if the user selects the correct answer), the specified correct answer, 
and the point value for the question. 

Within this quiz management system, the user is allowed to add new questions
to the external data file, view existing questions details, modify existing questions, and
delete existing questions.

Open Data Files:
The program contains a single question pool excel (csv) file that is loaded upon 
program start up.

Save Data Files:
The question pool excel (csv) file is automatically saved anytime someone 
updates a question, deletes a question, adds a new question, or exits the program.

Sequence of Events:
The program starts up presenting the home page which shows the user the game
name, a welcome message and a preview of the question pool. From the home page,
the user can navigate through all the pages of the management system
by pressing the commands in the menu bar.

Run the Game:
The game executes when the user selects "Take Quiz" from the Quiz drop down menu.
The quiz interface shows the user the question text to one question, the answer choices, 
and allows the user to enter a single answer. The user is able to see the number of
question asked, how many are left out of 3, and how many questions they have answered
correctly. After answering a question, the user is given positive or negative
feedback, along with points earned and how many questions asked is updated.

Each question has a point value of 1, 2, or 3.
