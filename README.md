# Python
Python programs created in PyCharm.
Using the branch drop down menu underneath the "Code" tab on the left, toggle between the different branches to see the files for each program.

Each branch contains the one to many files needed for each program. 

Information about the program is included in either a "ReadMe" text file or a description above each python file.
